# what the code does: 
a simple calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication and division

# Pseudocode:   
1. create a dictionary with the options as keys and the functions as values
2. create a while loop that runs until the user decides to stop
3. ask the user to select an operation
4. if the user selects a valid operation, ask the user to enter two numbers
5. if the user selects an invalid operation, print an error message
6. if the user selects a valid operation, perform the operation on the two numbers
7. print the result
8. ask the user if they want to perform another calculation
9. if the user wants to perform another calculation, repeat steps 3-8
10. if the user does not want to perform another calculation, exit the loop
